## Last's  Week's Progress:
1. Tried running your Django backend server but encountered Python environment issues because the Python executable wasn’t found.
2. Faced issues with missing manage.py and incorrect directory locations, which caused errors when running Django commands.
3. Created a fresh Django project (backend_project) and an app (accounts) inside your backend folder.4
4. Implemented a user registration API endpoint with serializers, views, and URL routing.
5. Learned how to test your API using Postman with step-by-step instructions for sending a POST request to your registration API endpoint.
6. Encountered issues when trying to test the API with Postman (Postman didn’t work as expected)
