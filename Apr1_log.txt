Last week's progress:
1.
## Project Idea
PlayProfile is a social network for gamers to build gaming profiles, show favorite games, and connect with other gamers across all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox, Mobile).

## Problem
Gamers today are spread across many platforms without an easy way to connect socially.

## Solution
An open, cross-platform website focused only on gaming profiles and gamer friendships.

## PlayProfile Simple Workflow

B --> C(Dashboard)

C --> E(Find Gamers)
E --> F(Send Friend Requests)
F --> G(Build Friends List)
