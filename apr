This week
I initialized a Git repository and created the base project folder structure, including separate folders for the frontend (React) and backend (Django).

I set up a Python virtual environment and installed Django and Django REST Framework for the backend.

I created a new Django project named backend.

For the frontend, I initialized a new React project using Vite with the TypeScript + SWC template.
