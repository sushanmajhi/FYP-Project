Literature Review on Theme: Gamification and User Retention
Gamification is a powerful tool to enhance user motivation, especially in digital platforms that aim to build communities. In the context of GameSphare, it plays a key role in encouraging users to engage with the platform over time.

Hamari and Koivisto (2015) discuss how gamification elements such as badges, levels, and stats contribute to user satisfaction and continuous use. Their study in the International Journal of Information Management supports GameSphare’s plan to incorporate profile-based achievements and badges to increase engagement.

Further, Deterding et al. (2011) define gamification as “the use of game design elements in non-game contexts” and highlight how meaningful implementation — beyond points and leaderboards — drives long-term participation. GameSphare applies this by offering identity-based gamification, such as tracking a user’s gaming history, skill level, and platform preference.

Finally, Taylor (2018) emphasizes how modern gamers want to showcase their playstyles, achievements, and social presence. GameSphare allows users to do exactly that through customizable profiles and visible progress, creating a platform that blends utility with motivation.
